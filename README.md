# AI usage
I follow some of ur steps of using the AI at first, and then i try to continue but since im quite bad at UI and new to qt creator i fix some of the UI issue with the Gemini AI, such as recolor the buttons, adding new text for the iteration, and else. at first, i try to make the algorithm based on the book by my own, but i ask AI help to test the iteration and i think i still got it wrong until i submit this im not quite sure what number is right at this point.

# Collaboration usage
Since i don't know the number for the right iteration, i asked some friends to recalculate and fix my algorithm i asked about the number when the dot is 3 and else, ended up im confused :)
